# Variables

Variables are containers that you give a name to that hold any piece of information or data for you. Variables are used to store data in memory, and to access that data later.

The two main parts of a variable are the name and its value. Because they are variables, their value is meant to vary over time, in other words change. Let's create our first one.

## Declaration

When you want to create a variable, you need to declare it. This tells JavaScript "hey, I want this name to represent a variable".

Let's say you want a variable to hold the number of apples you eat every day. It may look something like this:

```js
let apples;
```
You have now declared a variable called apples, but have yet to give it a value.

## Variable Naming Guidelines

Below are the rules for how to name your variables.

1. The first character has to be a letter, an underscore, or a dollar sign.

2. After the first character, you are now free to use numbers if you'd like, however, you cannot start with a number.

Examples of valid JavaScript variable names:

```js
let apples;
let $apples;
let _apples;
let app_les;
let apples4eva;
let apple$;
```

And examples of invalid JavaScript variable names:

```js
let 1apples;
let app les;
let #apples;
let apple%;
```

Also important to note is that variable names are case-sensitive, so Apples and apples are different variables.

## Initialization

After you have declared a variable with a valid name, you can now initialize it, which is to give the variable its initial value. This is the value that it will have when you first declare it.

The syntax for this is simple and intuitive. Let's say you look at a modest 384 memes a day. Here is how you would initialize your variable.
