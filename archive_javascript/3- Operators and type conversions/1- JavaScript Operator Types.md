### JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic calculations. For example,

```js
const number = 3 + 5; // 8
```

Here, the ```+``` operator is used to add two operands.

| Operator      | Name               | Example       |
| :---          |    :----:          |          ---: |
| ```+```       | Addition           | ```x + y```   |
| ```-```       | Subtraction        | ```x - y ```  |
| ```*```       | Multiplication     | ```x * y ```  |
| ```/```       | Division           | ```x / y ```  |
| ```%```       | Remainder          | ```x / y ```  |
| ```++```       | Increment (increments by 1)  | ```x / y ```  |
| ```--```       | Decrement (decrements by 1)	 | ```x / y ```  |
