# Concise Body Arrow Functions
JavaScript also provides several ways to refactor arrow function syntax. The most condensed form of the function is known as concise body. Weâ€™ll explore a few of these techniques below:


1. Functions that take only a single parameter do not need that parameter to be enclosed in parentheses. However, if a function takes zero or multiple parameters, parentheses are required.

2. A function body composed of a single-line block does not need curly braces. Without the curly braces, whatever that line evaluates will be automatically returned. The contents of the block should immediately follow the arrow => and the return keyword can be removed. This is referred to as implicit return.

So if we have a function:

```js
const squareNum = (num) => {
  return num * num;
};
```

We can refactor the function to:

```js
const squareNum = num => num * num;
```

Notice the following changes:

* The parentheses around num have been removed, since it has a single parameter.
<br>
* The curly braces { } have been removed since the function consists of a single-line block.
<br>
* The return keyword has been removed since the function consists of a single-line block.
