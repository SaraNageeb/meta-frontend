# Create a Variable: let

As mentioned in the previous exercise, the let keyword was introduced in ES6. The let keyword signals that the variable can be reassigned a different value. Take a look at the example:

```js
let meal = 'Enchiladas';
console.log(meal); // Output: Enchiladas
meal = 'Burrito';
console.log(meal); // Output: Burrito
```
Another concept that we should be aware of when using let (and even var) is that we can declare a variable without assigning the variable a value. In such a case, the variable will be automatically initialized with a value of undefined:

```js
let price;
console.log(price); // Output: undefined
price = 350;
console.log(price); // Output: 350
```

Notice in the example above:

1. If we donâ€™t assign a value to a variable declared using the let keyword, it automatically has a value of undefined.

2. We can reassign the value of the variable.
