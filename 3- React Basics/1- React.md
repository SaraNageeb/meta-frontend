# React Basics
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React makes building and maintaining the user interface of your application faster and easier by breaking it up into smaller, reusable components. It also helps eliminate the complexity that comes with updating your DOM elements when the user interacts with your application.

## Add React to a Project
The easiest way to get started by far is by using a tool called create-react-app. It is possible (but not necessary) to install create-react-app on your machine if the npm tool that was installed along with Node has a version number of at least 5.3.

Let's create an application called part1 and navigate to its directory.

npx create-react-app part1
cd part1
The application is run as follows

npm start
By default, the application runs in localhost port 3000 with the address http://localhost:3000
