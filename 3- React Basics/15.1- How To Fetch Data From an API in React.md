# Fetching data using inbuilt fetch API.
All modern browsers come with an inbuilt fetch Web API, which can be used to fetch data from APIs. In this tutorial, we will be fetching data from the JSON Server APIs.

***
In the above below:

1. We have a ```useEffect``` hook, which will be executed once the component is mounted. Inside the useEffect hook, we are calling ```fetchData``` function.

2. In the ```fetchData``` function, we are making the API call to fetch users and set the users to a local state.

3. If users exist, then we are looping through them and displaying their names as a list.


Since the API calls are asynchronous, ```fetch``` API returns a **Promise**. Hence, we chain the ```then``` method with a callback, which will be called when we receive the response from the server/backend.

Since we need the response to be resolved to a JSON, we call ```.json()``` method with the returned response. Again ```.json()``` return a promise, therefore we need to chain another then method to resolve the second promise.

Since the ```then``` callbacks have only one line, we can use implicit returns to shorten the ```fetchData``` method as follows:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react"

const UsingFetch = () => {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([])

  const fetchData = () => {
    fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users")
      .then(response => {
        return response.json()
      })
      .then(data => {
        setUsers(data)
      })
  }
`
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData()
  }, [])

  return (
    <div>
      {users.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {users.map(user => (
            <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}

export default UsingFetch
```
