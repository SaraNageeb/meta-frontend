# Iterator Documentation
There are many additional built-in array methods, a complete list of which is on the MDN’s Array iteration methods page.

The documentation for each method contains several sections:

1. A short definition.
2. A block with the correct syntax for using the method.
3. A list of parameters the method accepts or requires.
4. The return value of the function.
5. An extended description.
6. Examples of the method’s use.
7. Other additional information.

In the instructions below, there are some errors in the code. Use the documentation for a given method to determine the error or fill in a blank to make the code run correctly.
